# FlowSense

FlowSense is an app designed to compute FFT of Android microphone signal, and run regression/classification models to predict airflow.
It uses the open source [Noise library](https://github.com/paramsen/noise) which uses [kissfft](https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft) for FFT computation.

## App/Project
